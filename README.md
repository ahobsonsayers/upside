# upside

A repo of docker composer files üê≥

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahobsonsayers/upside ~/docker
```

## Setup with [dockge](https://github.com/louislam/dockge)

```bash
docker compose -f dockge/compose.yaml up -d
```

## Why the name **Upside**?

The **Docker** mascot is a **whale** (called [Moby Dock](https://www.docker.com/blog/call-me-moby-dock/)), the film [**The Whale**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13833688/) had a scored **composed** by [Rob Simonsen](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1387379), Rob Simonsen also **composed** the score for the film [The **Upside**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1987680) (a remake of the french film [Intouchables](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/))

Also instead of using `docker run`, we are staring services using the other **side** of Docker using `docker compose`. Some might say... the **up side** ü§ì

I know, its tenuous...
